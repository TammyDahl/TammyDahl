<h1>Hi, I’m Tammy </h1>

I'm a San Diego-based Computer Science grad with hands-on tech experience and a passion for turning data into insight. I recently wrapped up my degree at SDSU and bring several years of industry experience, including a product-facing role at Microsoft. I'm currently looking for full-time opportunities in data science or data analytics, with a focus on meaningful, remote work that offers room to grow.

<h2>👨‍💻 Notable Projects:</h2>

<b> 🧠 [Tweet Classifier for Disaster Response](https://github.com/TammyDahl/DisasterResponseTweetClassifier) </b>
  - Built a multi-label NLP model to classify disaster-related tweets using text preprocessing, TF-IDF, logistic regression, and random forest. Designed for real-time emergency filtering with scikit-learn and Flask. Showcases experience in natural language processing and model deployment.

<b> 🍳 [Recipe Recommendation App](https://github.com/TammyDahl/RecipeRecommendationApp) </b>
  - Worked on a team to build an AI-powered recommendation system using Word2Vec, K-Means clustering, and cosine similarity to match user input with relevant recipes. Emphasizes experience with unsupervised learning, recommender logic, and translating user preferences into structured data.

<b> 🧬 [Alzheimer's vs Alcoholism: Data Analysis](https://github.com/TammyDahl/AlzheimersVAlcoholismDataAnalysis) </b>
  - Performed exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and built a random forest classifier to examine how alcohol consumption correlates with dementia progression. Used pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn to analyze real-world health datasets and communicate results with visual storytelling.

<b> 🔒 [Laser Tripwire System](https://github.com/TammyDahl/LaserTripwireSystem) </b>
  - Developed a Raspberry Pi–based event detection system inspired by real-world patient monitoring. Used Python and IFTTT to trigger real-time alerts when a beam is broken. Demonstrates real-world sensor integration, automation, and basic IoT data flow concepts.

<b> 🛍️ [Retail Store Kiosk Simulation](https://github.com/TammyDahl/RetailStoreKioskSim) </b>
  - Collaborated on the design and simulation of a clothing store POS system. Contributed to UML diagrams, ERD, data dictionary, and Java-based simulation of inventory, transactions, and user roles. Highlights object modeling, database logic, and structured system design.
